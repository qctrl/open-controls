# Q-CTRL Open Controls

Q-CTRL Open Controls is an open-source Python package that makes it easy to
create and deploy established error-robust quantum control protocols from the
open literature. The aim of the package is to be the most comprehensive library
of published and tested quantum control techniques developed by the community,
with easy to use export functions allowing users to deploy these controls on:

- Custom quantum hardware
- Publicly available cloud quantum computers
- The [Q-CTRL product suite](https://q-ctrl.com/products/)

Anyone interested in quantum control is welcome to contribute to this project.

3.1 General obligations

You must only use the platform and the access method for your own lawful
internal business purposes and in accordance with this agreement. You must never
use the platform and the access method for the creation of publicly accessible
tools and applications.

You acknowledge that the platform is continuously evolving, subject to ongoing
development and improvement, and may not be suitable for all uses. The platform
must not be used for any purposes on which critical infrastructure or human life
depends, or in circumstances where any failure or malfunction may result in
personal injury.

In most circumstances, you are solely responsible for the interoperability of
the platform with your computer systems, software and hardware. We accept no
responsibility for any liability in connection with the manner in which the
platform interoperates (or fails to interoperate) with your, or any third party,
systems, software or hardware.

In the case of a subscription to an enterprise plan, which includes the
incorporation of software customization and professional services,
specifications on interoperability will be covered under a separate agreement.

3.2 Access conditions

You must ensure that all credentials required to access the platform are kept
secure and confidential. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized use
of your credentials or any other breach of security and you must take all other
actions that we reasonably deem necessary to maintain or enhance the security of
our computing systems and networks and your access to the platform.

When accessing and using the platform, you must:

  (a) not attempt to undermine the security or integrity of our computing
      systems or networks or, where the platform is hosted by a third party,
      that third party's computing systems and networks;

  (b) not use, or misuse, the platform in any way which may impair the
      functionality of the platform or the access method, or other systems used
      to deliver the platform or impair the ability of any other user to use the
      platform or the access method;

  (c) not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any data, information or
      materials (other than those to which you have been given express
      permission to access) or to the computer systems on which the platform is
      hosted;

  (d) not transmit via, or input into, the platform any files that may damage
      any computing devices or software, content that may be offensive, or
      material or data in violation of any law (including data or other material
      protected by copyright or trade secrets which you do not have the right to
      use); and

  (e) not attempt to modify, copy, adapt, reproduce, disassemble, decompile or
      reverse engineer any computer programs or algorithms forming part of, or
      used to deliver, the platform or the access method.

3.3 Communication conditions

If you use any communication tools available through the access method (such as
email, chat or forums), you must agree only to use such communication tools for
lawful and legitimate purposes. You must not use any such communication tool for
posting or disseminating any material unrelated to the use of the platform,
including: offers of goods or services for sale, unsolicited commercial email,
files that may harm any other person's computing devices or software, content
that may be offensive or in violation of any law (including material that is
protected by copyright or trade secrets which you do not have the right to use).

When you make any communication via the access method, you represent that you
are permitted to make such communication. We are under no obligation to ensure
that any communications are legitimate or that relate only to the use of the
platform. As with any other software, you must exercise caution when using
communication tools available via, or relating to, the platform. However, we
reserve the right to remove any communication at any time in our sole
discretion.

4. Payment

4.1 Fee

Unless you are accessing a trial or free version of the platform, an invoice for
the fee will be issued either annually or each month starting one month (the
"billing period") from the date you first agreed to the terms of this agreement.
All invoices will include the fee for the following billing period. We will
continue invoicing you according to the agreed schedule until this agreement is
terminated in accordance with clause 8.

The fee may be varied by us no more than once every 12 months. We will give you
at least 30 days' notice of any changes. If you do not accept any increase in
the fee then you may terminate this agreement or elect to change to a different
plan within such notice period.

If you elect to upgrade to a plan with additional features, your fee will
increase to our then current list price for such plan, unless we have agreed to
give you access at a different price. You may elect to downgrade to a plan with
fewer features, however, no refund will be given for any fee previously paid or
payable. The fee for the subsequent billing period will decrease to our then
current list price for such plan, unless we have agreed to give you access at a
different price.

4.2 Invoicing and payment

All invoices will be sent to your nominated email address. You must pay all
amounts specified in any invoice by the due date on the invoice. If you have set
up auto-billing arrangements with us then we will deduct the payment
automatically under the terms of those arrangements. You must ensure that you
have adequate funds in your nominated bank account or a valid credit card to
enable all automatic payments to be processed when due.

If invoices are not paid in full by the due date (including due to any failure
of an automatic payment) then, in addition to any other rights we have, we may:

  (a) suspend your access to the platform immediately and without further
      notice, and

  (b) charge you interest on the overdue amount at the United States Federal
      Reserve Federal Funds Rate plus four per cent (4%) per annum, calculated
      from the date the payment became due to the date of full and final
      payment.

4.3 Taxes

Unless expressly stated otherwise, all amounts stated to be payable in this
agreement (or related documents such as quotations or invoices) exclude GST.

If GST is imposed on any supply made under, or in accordance with, this
agreement, the recipient of the taxable supply must pay an additional amount
equal to the GST payable on or for the taxable supply. Payment of the additional
amount will be made at the same time as payment of the taxable supply is
required to be made in accordance with this agreement.

If this document requires a party to pay for, reimburse or contribute to any
expense, loss, indemnity or outgoing (reimbursable expense) suffered or incurred
by another party, the amount required to be paid, reimbursed or contributed by
the first party will be the sum of:

  (a) the amount of the reimbursable expense less the input tax credits (if any)
      to which the other party is entitled in respect of the reimbursable
      expense; and

  (b) if the other party's recovery from the first party is a taxable supply,
      any GST payable in respect of that supply.

In this clause, "GST" and other words defined in the "A New Tax System (Goods
and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth)" or subordinate legislation have the meaning
given in that legislation.

If we are required to charge you value added, goods and services or similar
taxes and duties under the laws of any other jurisdiction, you must pay all such
additional amounts at the same time as payment of the taxable supply is required
to be made.

7. Warranties and liability

7.1 Authority

You warrant that:

  (a) where you have registered to use the platform on behalf of another person,
      you have the authority to agree to this agreement on behalf of that person
      and agree that by registering to use the platform you bind the person on
      whose behalf you act to the performance of any and all obligations that
      you become subject to by virtue of this agreement, without limiting your
      own personal obligations under this agreement; and

  (b) you are authorized to use the platform and that you are authorized to

Subject to clause 7.3, you acknowledge and agree that:

  (a) quantum computing is at an early stage of development and the provision
      of, access to, and use of, the platform and support is on an "as is" basis
      and at your own risk;

  (b) it is your sole responsibility to determine that the platform meets the
      needs of your business and is suitable for the purposes for which it is

      assurances, or warranties (express or implied), including warranties as to

Where any prescribed terms apply, the liability of us to you for a breach of
such a term is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. Certain
guarantees and rights may be conferred on you which cannot be excluded,
restricted or modified. If so, then the parties agree that, to the maximum
extent permitted by law, our liability under those guarantees and rights is
limited to the re-supply of the relevant goods or services or the payment of the

for the supply of goods or services, and which the law expressly provides, may

modified only to a limited extent (including rights you may have as a consumer
under the "Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth)").

of, or reliance on, the platform, the access method or support.

If you suffer loss or damage as a result of our negligence or failure to comply
with this agreement, any claim by you against us arising from such negligence or
failure will be limited in respect of any one incident, or series of connected

by giving notice to the other party at least 30 days before the end of the
relevant payment period.

then current billing period up to and including the day of termination of this

described in your plan:

      support request;

      computers or networks used by you to access, or in conjunction with, the
      platform.

Unless otherwise specified in your plan, the support provided under this
agreement is not intended to be a replacement for end-user training, system
configuration or consulting. If we consider that a support request does not meet
the criteria for support under your plan then we may decline to respond to the
support request and may suggest alternative means of satisfying the support
request such as via professional services for additional training or consulting
or by entering into a more comprehensive support agreement that better meets
your requirements.

9.2 Service availability

We will use all reasonable endeavors to ensure that the platform is available to
the user for 90.0% of all scheduled available time, solely as it relates to the
hosting provider's network and server Internet access. Scheduled available time
shall be defined as 24 hours per day, seven days per week, excluding:

  (a) routine system maintenance downtime of up to six hours per week, which
      shall be scheduled outside of normal business hours if practical;

  (b) downtime to address specific critical software issues; and

  (c) any downtime caused by circumstances beyond the immediate control of us or
      our contractors.

dealt with in this agreement.

10.2 Amendment and waiver

This agreement may only be amended by agreement of the parties in writing. No
delay or indulgence by a party in enforcing this agreement will prejudice or
restrict the rights of that party. Any waiver of a party's rights must be

breach.

obligations under this agreement if the delay or failure is due to any cause
outside its reasonable control. This clause does not apply to any obligation to

You may not assign or novate any of your rights or obligations under this
agreement to any other person without our prior written consent (not to be
